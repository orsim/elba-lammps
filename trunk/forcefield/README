This directory contains all versions of the ELBA force field. The general
features of the ELBA model are described in this paper:

Orsi, M. and J. W. Essex. The ELBA force field for coarse-grain modeling 
of lipid membranes (submitted).

The ELBA force field is being constantly updated, extended and (hopefully)
improved, hence the "best" version to use is probably the latest.
