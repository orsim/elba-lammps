*** Installing LAMMPS ***
Detailed information on how to build LAMMPS can be found on the official
website (http://lammps.sandia.gov). Please read carefully.
Specific packages that need to be included because required by the ELBA model:
- DIPOLE
- MOLECULE
- USER-MISC
In general, LAMMPS installation procedures are specific to users's local 
machine(s). As examples, the next sections give protocols that work for me.

** Installing LAMMPS on the Iridis supercomputer **
This is how I install LAMMPS on the Iridis HPC machine at the University of 
Southampton.
- Download and extract LAMMPS tarball from official website
- Edit "src/MAKE/Makefile.linux":
	CC = mpicxx
	LINK = mpicxx
- cd src/
- make no-all
- make yes-dipole yes-molecule yes-user-misc
- make linux

** Installing LAMMPS on UOS machines **
This is how I install LAMMPS on my University of Southampton GNU/LINUX desktop.
- Download and extract LAMMPS tarball from official website
- Edit "src/MAKE/Makefile.linux":
	MPI_INC =  -I/local/software/openmpi/1.2.4/pgi-7.1/include
	MPI_PATH =  	-L/local/software/openmpi/1.2.4/pgi-7.1/lib
	MPI_LIB =	-lmpi -lpthread
- cd src/
- make no-all
- make yes-dipole yes-molecule yes-user-misc
- make linux
