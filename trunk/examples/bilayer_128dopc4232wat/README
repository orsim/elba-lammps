Simulation of preassembled lipid bilayer.

Various profiles are evaluated and averaged 'on the fly' - see
'profiles/*.zProfile'. These files can be further processed (using
the scripts in 'tools/') to obtain the *.dat curves.

The folder 'diffusion/' contains MSD data calculated on the fly by
LAMMPS and corresponding diffusion curves obtained with the 
'msd2diff.py' tool.

The folder 'area_volume/' contains area and volume per lipid data
averaged over time windows as defined in the input script. These
data can also be used to calculate compressibility moduli - tools
for this are not yet available, but will be...
